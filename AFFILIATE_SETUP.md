2. ‚è≥ **Approval Process**: Usually 2-3 business days
3. ‚è≥ **Integration**: Add Sovrn JavaScript to your site

### Step 2: Add Sovrn Script
Once approved, add this to your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Sovrn Commerce Script -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  var vglnk = {key: 'YOUR_SOVRN_KEY'};
  (function(d, t) {
    var s = d.createElement(t);
    s.type = 'text/javascript';
    s.async = true;
    s.src = '//cdn.viglink.com/api/vglnk.js';
    var r = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
    r.parentNode.insertBefore(s, r);
  }(document, 'script'));
</script>
```

### Step 3: Current Links Ready for Conversion
Your footer already contains these merchant links:

```typescript
const affiliateLinks = [
  {
    name: 'TurboTax',
    url: 'https://turbotax.intuit.com/lp/yoy/guarantees/',
    // Sovrn will auto-convert this to affiliate link
  },
  {
    name: 'H&R Block',
    url: 'https://www.hrblock.com/online-tax-filing/free-tax-filing/',
    // Sovrn will auto-convert this to affiliate link
  },
  {
    name: 'Credit Karma Tax',

    // Sovrn will auto-convert this to affiliate link

  {
    name: 'FreeTaxUSA',
